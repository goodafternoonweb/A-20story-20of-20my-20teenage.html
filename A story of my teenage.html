    <h6>Memories</h6>
    <p>Always be a man of big, strong, and kind heart.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I am Aashish Jha. I am from Nepal, Janakpur. I was born on 2068-08-08. I read in 8th standard. I am a boy who always dreams but never accomplishes my dreams. My life had played a very important role in my one friend ‘Aayushi’. Remember this name as the girl’s name as I am going to talk about her in this story. She is a girl who is very, kind humble and polite. She has played a vital role in making me a man. About 1.7 years when I was in class 7. I had firstly seen her. She was the third monitor of our class at that time. She was very talented and brilliant in studies and even in extra activities. I am not going to say you everything by making it round and round so I am explaining it directly. In class 7 I had a crush on her. I even took 3 months and I proposed her. She was been scared as she hasn’t even expected this from me. So, she denied my proposal and told me that we are adolescents now and at this time we have to focus on our career. But I myself don’t know why but I have told this to my all friends that ‘ I have proposed my girl, ‘ And even I shared our chats with everyone in the group. That made her feel more irritated and uncomfortable at that time but she didn’t said me anything tom me. After 4 to 5 months I have tried harder and harder and again got her trust. At that time I have trusted that Now I am not going to make her feel uncomfortable with me. But again after 3 or 4 months I don’t know or remember but I have again done something inappropriate with her. Whole class was doing discussions about us and even many of our friends started to blackmail me. After that I myself don’t remember but how I had became her closest friend but while coming to class 8 I kept realizing that I have became a headache for her, and I myself started to feel that I am irritating her so after coming in class 8 , I started to make distance among us. She even ask me at starting that why are u behaving like this, but at that time i wasn’t able to tell her anything. But after 4 to 5 months of coming in 8th standered , we both have many issues, fights between each other. So, on 25 feburary we both have a very long discussion, u can say it as a fight also and from that time we both decide that we are only classmate and the friendship can only stand on trust and even I have lose the trust from her , and she has also. So, we decided to end this friendship which was only for name.  So, we decided to be separated as she will be on her way and I will be on my way. So from 25 Feb. to about 40 days we haven’t talk.</p>

    <h3><mark>Aayushi Karn-Aashish Jha</mark></h3>
    <p>Something’s break your heart but fix your vision…</p>

    <p>In the previous part I have told that I had tried to be separated with her. But I have even said near last that I have also lost my trust from her. Do you know what had broken my trust from her?.. I will explain and this is going to be our today’s topic, so be in your comfortable position to understand what had happened……</p>

    <p>So, it was the time of picnic, about 1 or 2 months before the picnic, she told us means her all close friends about her first love ‘Kishan Swankar”. She made us introduce with him. In first meet I found him a very nice person but, after some time he showed his real face. One day Deepak(my classmate) threaten kishan to leave Aayushi as he was also loving her or you can say attracted towards her. He said him that I will kill u or make u sit on legs blab la bla.. But in return Kishan also said that I will also make u kidnap or beat u by coming your home. That just hurt Deepak’s ego. After that he told Aayush( our classmate) about these threating case. And Aayush has taken the side of Deepak as he was his best friend. One day Aayush called Kishan and told him to meet him beside the school. That day both Aayush and Kishan were in fom. Aayush forcefully called Deepak in front of Kishan as he was totally sacred of kishan’s threat. Even he came outside, After coming outside he just stand in front of kishan and without wasting any second kishan just slap him hardly. And at that time if Deepak want than he can fight with him for this behavior as it was beside our school and aayush had also called senior class boys for the fight. But Deepak was very fattu means after having a slap from kishan he just leave from there. Kishan also taken a leave from there. At that day I saw that Aayushi was just crying in front of Kishan for to go from there. She just kept saying him baby please go. That day Deepak understood that Aayushi is never going to be with him. Only here is the difference that he understood first than me. And now it is the picnic time. During picnic aayushi had again made Deepak impress by her words that’ I don’t know why he had done this’ ,`I am really sorry’ I have even broke up with him. After 5 to 6 months, we all were observing her , she was following Kishan on instagram and tiktok, I even asked her that time that why are you following him, that she replied that` Are you scolding me that why I have followed him’ and she said this in such an inappropriate tune that I was feeling bad so I called her and there we have many more arguments. But at the end she told me indirectly that whatever I do is my choice either I follow him or not. You are not the dictator of my choice. After 2, 3 months again she was keep following him so we all understood that she is a broad mind wali ladki who say something and do something. And due to this reason I have no trust upon her at that time.</p>

    <h3><mark>Aayushi Karn-Aashish Jha-Kishan Swankar-Deepak Sah<mark></h3>

    <p>Some bonds are unbreakable.</p>

    <p>Hello everyone , today I am going to explain what had happened after 25 Feb…..</p>

    <p>As in starting of the page I have said that some bonds are unbreakable. After about 1 month means about 43 days. I was started to remind her in my everyday life. So, I firstly messaged her as I have made her block for more than 30 days so I messaged her firstly that why` haven’t you blocked me’. As in the first page I have said that Aayushi is a kind, loyal and heartfull person. So, she hadn’t blocked me. She replyed me that I can be rude but not a heartless one. And that made me feel that she was also a little upset without talking with me. So, I messeged her first and what ever happened is given below…..</p>

    <p>This was our first chat.</p>

    <p>And this is the last….<br><br>

    Even one of my friend Anukalp has played a important role in all this. He is the man who is the luckiest man in this story. He is who Aayushi really like. Aayushi liked him since class 6. In class 6 we both are in different section. So, at that time I didn’t known to aayushi well. But Anukalp used to go with her in van since class 4 so he and Aayushi, both are known to each other very well. In class 7 our section joint together so from the starting of class7 I and everyone of the class were came to know that there is something between Anukalp and Aayushi by seeing their behavior towards each other. But as time runs , everyone realized that there is nothing between them but even though I have doubt and my doubt cleared after the third terminal. In previous page as I have told you all that we went on a picnic so there I understood that they were best friends. As they used to help each other on climbing mountains and by catching each other hand like bla bla bla. But I understood there as I have asked Aayushi personally that what is there between you and Anukalp. And there she told me that they are just best friends. But while the time goes, Amishi had became the best friend of Aayushi. I even don’t care after that.</p>

    <p>After 5 months……</p>

    <p>Now, many months had past these things. Even now, the whole class had started to treat me accurately without adding her name with me which even been good for her. Now, she had also started me to treat well and to take a step to make our friendship, Aayushi even gave me a beautiful present on my birthday as well as I had done on her’s on her previous birthday. And even she had started to support me while I use to participate in different types of competitions like in speech, debate or quiz. Even she use to tell me about my mistakes, and tell me to be conscious about it on your upcoming times. Even during exams, her seat had lied just in back of me. So, while exam days we use to talk a lot. As much as I don’t think we have done in our normal days and we both even use to help each other while exams. So, exam days use to be mine best days. Even now, I don’t use to say or ask her that why she talked with other boys, why you have done this or that. As to show your feelings to someone, then the first step should be to leave her free from your every action. Every person in this world like their freedom. So, let be her free.</p>

    <p>I don’t know who is reading this all but I hope you will understand the feeling of an uncompleted story by reading this. And might be in your thoughts I am wrong, but in everyone’s story, somebody is wrong. And in my story I know I am wrong. From whatever happened, I had learned a lesson that, in excitement we use to do a lot of things and there might be some acts are good and some acts are bad. And some of our acts can’t not only mentally disturb you but it results the same on others also. So, we should have to do our each and every action carefully. And after doing a mistake or after hurting someone, you can only do 2 things. First to accept your mistake, Second to never do that mistake again.</p>

    <p>And loving somebody in your teenage can destroy you mentally. So, be independent first both physically, economically and emotionally.</p>

    <p>Even I use to think that how it will be if she me were together. But now, I have made her a memorable chapter of my life. A person who had taught me that what and how feelings use to be confess. And the meaning of forgiveness, gentle and how to be gratitude full all the time…………</p>

    <h3><mark>Today was our picnic of class 8</mark></h3>
    <p>Today we had gone to bindhi from school. We all had gone there through bus. All classmates including Me, Aayushi, Anukalp, Deepak, Amishi and everyone. Aayuwu had taken pictures with everyone including me. It was like one of the best time of my whole class 8. And even she had talked with me today. Even I want to test her that is she trusting me now or not so , I told Samridh that say infront of her that I had shown him mine and her’s chat. And even when Samridh said this to her, she didn’t replied anything. So, I also didn’t say anything at that time. I thought if she trusts me now than she will know the truth, but if she not than let it be to her, as we both had done a joke act.</p>

    <p>After a while, we had our meal. And she is vegetarian so she had ate separately than us. And even today Piyush( Son of headman/ 3rd founder of school)  was also present there. Even he had made me eat an gulab jamun by putting it directly in my mouth. It was a bit amazed moment for me as I use to think he is only strict but he is even very friendly to good students. But now I also found his behavior and my response to him when he made me eat was like, ‘’ Ehh, thank u sir. Have u ate”” a bit like this. And even today I had ate like about more than 15 pieces. And seeing this many more girls were like been shocked as in our class, the most pieces were eaten by me. After this all, we had even played holi. And Aayuwu had even coloured me on my cheeks which was very beautiful moment for me. But she had spent a lot of time with Anukalp’s  group which was a bit making me jealous at first but after some time I said to myself that, ‘’ she is even not going to be mine, so I should only spent as much time as I can with her, I should not be jealous that why she is talking or dancing with me.”’ And this way, later I let her to enjoy with other’s without making any feeling of jealousy and overthinking. Its her life and she knows appropriately that what she have to do and what not. Later we had returned to our school. Girls went about 45 minutes before than us in van. As we have to collect and gather all picnic stuffs like plates, buckets, gas cylinders, stove and many more. After setting this all in bus and van. I and about 7 students were arrived in bus to school and others in the van as the van had again gone to take them and other required stuffs.</p>

    <p>After coming home, I had talked with Aayuwu and Boby a bit and sat in the prepration of debate competition.</p>

    <p>From today’s trip I had came to know that things had changed a lot in this 1 year. Aayushi had started to take me as her good friend and I am also very happy now, and now I also don’t want we should be in a relationship as she is happy a lot while I am her friend and if I will again say her that I feel for her more than friends than the situation will be more serious and she again have to face those traumas and unhappiness and I don’t even want to make so……</p>

    <p>Even tomorrow in debate she is mine competitor but I am not afraid a bit also as she is the one who use to teach me after my every competitions that how was it, what were the mistakes and how should I improve it. So, this much for today.</p>

    <h3><mark>Some memorable moments….</mark></h3>
    <p>As I had mentioned we are in eight slandered. So, today we all had went to give the examination of boards to Gogal Prasad Secondary school. We had arrived there at around 1 p.m. Our examination was from 2p.m. So, today was our first examination so in the mean time we went to find our seats in classes. Our school center and Mother Teresa School center lied in the same school. And Kishan also use to study in Mother Teresa so he had also came there. Firstly when I saw him I didn’t reacted that much. But when I saw the reaction and behavior of Aayuwu friends towards her and Kishan. That had made me a bit awkward and shocked. And even Aayushi also laughed like she accepts that Kishan is still in her life and became very happy. Our examination was good but after coming home, I had tried to talk with her about Kishan indirectly. Ike I had asked her that, ‘’ Was Kishan also today in Gogal Prasad?, don’t u think he had been changed by his behavior, attitude and physical outlook? And many more. But she didn’t replied me anything clearly. And later, I also stop taking with her about Kishan.  I know to forget first attraction is hard but you are not even trying to overcome from him. Than saying that, ‘’ I am not with him anymore’’ is useless.</p>

    <p>Today, I am writing this all here. It will always remind me that in mine teenager also such an incident had happened. To met Aayushi was not only like getting her. The life learning messages that I had got from her will always help me in my future. Even she had been the first girl to whom I had talked and made a good friendship relation with in my friend circle. Some people use to come in life and teach us a lot of things and after sometimes they go away. Nobody is permanent in life, not even our parents. They also have to go from this world one day. So, people had came and will come in your life. They will teach you learning lessons, either good or bad. Try to learn the good lessons from them and even if you will get time then tell the try to be an good example for everyone. Life is very short. This is just teenage, if you will be depressed from now over temporary people than there is no meaning of life which god had provided you. God had given you life to Play, Work, learn, make friends , and to be happy.  And try to be happy and make other also happy.</p>

    <h3><u><mark>Conclusion:</mark></u></h3>
    <p> I only want to see a smile on her face, either the reason behind the smile is me or somebody else. Even I have also understood with the time that she is not for me so why to put effort on such person who you know that she is not going to be with you. Even now she literally just hate me and just waiting for class 10 so after 10th I will not have any contact or friendship with her. I don’t know about her but I am never gonna to forget her as she had played  a vital role in making me an ambivert from an introvert. She is the only one to whom I have given that much time after my family.</p>

    <p>Never force somebody to choose you. And if they just ignore you than just leave them, one day when you will be quite far from them from where they can only remember you . At that time they will feel how we feel for them at that time. This line is not for her, I have just put this line to make it a bit relatable for you.</p>

    <p> I will always miss you Aayuwu. And might be if luck wants than we will meet together in future. But at that time we both will be changed but feelings are such, which can never change. Good bye.</p>
